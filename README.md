# MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON
- In this project we are going to train a neural network to identify to which class the given wine sample belongs to
- The Neural Network here consists of 4 layers: 1 input layer, 2 hidden layers and 1 output layer
- We are using the load_wine dataset from sklearn library which is an inbuilt dataset to train the Neural Network
- The accuracy of this model is 96.3%
